  When the project was introduced, both of us were attracted to the idea of coding interactive art. We decided to pursue a project aimed to create an interactive scrolling background, much like the live wall-screens of Android products. We did this using art by Hwei-Shin, which we transformed into a background, platforms, and sprites to form our live background.

  Our results were a scrolling background that continuously moved through our background image, seamlessly connecting the end and beginning of the image while looping through. Platform clouds floated at varying speeds and directions above the background. There were also a variety of other sprites, such as hot air balloons, flowers, and cacti that added depth to our scenery.

  We implemented our program using the Pygame software. We started with a SpriteSheet class, which would take sprite data we stored in a separate "constants" code, and get the image associated with each sprite. Then, we created a Cloud class, which specifically formed our cloud sprites using the information from constants and the image file. The next class, our MovingCloud class, treated the clouds as platforms, which allowed the clouds to shift locations without user input. Fortunately,because we were working with clouds, there was less pressure to enforce physics like most platforms.

  We then used a superclass Scene to define the objects, and create subclasses that would define the scenery. In this, created a function that would shift the world and shift the platform clouds at separate rates. We chose to include this here instead of in our initial background class to make the code more cohesive and efficient. The next class was a Summer class to call and set the actual cloud platforms. We also spent time trying to create a Star class to form Star Sprites, and a Player class that would allow for click and point triggered animation, however there was some issue when we tried to blit the stars.

  Reflecting back on our project experience, there were definitely things that worked better than others. Our actual ideation process went really well, as we were both passionate about similar topics. We also did pivot our project at a reasonable time, because initially we wanted to work with hardware to create a lighting display. The project was fairly well scoped for the time period, but it would've been a lot easier to manage if we did not lose that first weekend. Both teammates did put quite a bit of time into the project, however Hwei-Shin was far more successful. While Jessie put a lot of hours into the project and worked with ninjas, she struggled and was not able to contribute as much. Jessie was also gone for the main weekend of the project, which made it hard to pursue our initial plan of Paired Programming throughout this project. Thus, going forward, we would definitely work in the Paired Programming style more often. We would also try to implement more unit testing throughout our work, and also work towards making more interactive sprites.
